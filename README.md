A simple mod that informs the user which of the eight "Kingdoms", 
centered around the origin as 8 "Slices", as well as 8 inner "Origin Plots". 
This is meant to help organize 8 players onto a map.

Although it automatically monitors one's position, a key (;) can be pressed (or remapped to another key) to manually check where one is.
